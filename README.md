## Abstract
This project aims to create an CDC portal for our college that will provide a streamlined and efficient platform to conduct the placement process by automating all the manual work involved in the process and eliminating the need for costly third-party websites(superset) currently which we are using (which do not provide flexibility) to improve the overall recruitment experience for all parties involved.

## Problem Statement
Currently, The placement and internship process at IIT(ISM) Dhanbad is mostly
manual. SCPT members need to do a lot of manual work, and most of their time is
wasted working with excel sheets.

On the student side, they use a third-party web app named 'superset', which comes with its own limitations.
Firstly, Superset is based on a subscription model and costs money, Secondly they
don't provide any flexibility according to our needs and many of our requirements are
still fulfilled manually.

On the company side, there is no such portal at all. Everything is done manually
through emails like sending them JNF/INF in word format, uploading these data to
superset, filtering the database and sending them a list of eligible students etc.
This is a serious problem as most of the time of SCPT members is wasted on these
redundant tasks instead of being utilized in grabbing new opportunities and thus
hampers the placement stats of the college.

# The main problems with superset are:
--> **Lack of flexibilities**
e.g., if we need any extra
functionality for a smooth
recruitment process that
third-party websites will
not provide that.

--> **Costly**
e.g., subscription fees, commissions, and other associated costs.

--> **Privacy issue**
Third-party websites are
getting details about students &
Companies registering for the
recruitment process.
e.g., student's resume, No. Of
companies registering, CTC, etc

# Solutions
* To solve these we will develop a cdc portal that will automate all the manual
redundant work done by SCPT. This will allow us to have complete control
over the user experience, as well as the features and functionality of the
portal.
* In this way we can reduce our dependency on third party software and also
the cost associated with them.
* By creating our own college cdc portal, we can ensure that the data of both
students and companies remains safe and secure. When using third-party
websites, there is always a risk that sensitive information could be
compromised or misused.
* With our own portal, we will have complete control over the data and can
implement robust security measures to protect it. This can include using
encryption technology to safeguard sensitive information like student
resumes and contact information. We can also implement user
authentication and authorization features to ensure that only authorized
users have access to the data.
* Furthermore, we can create a transparent privacy policy that outlines how
student and company data will be collected, stored, and used. This will give
users peace of mind and confidence that their data is being handled
responsibly.
* Creating our college CDC portal can be a cost-effective solution eliminating
the need for expensive third-party websites. By building our own portal, we
can save on subscription fees, commissions, and other associated costs.
* To create a cost-effective solution, we can use open-source software and
cloud-based infrastructure to reduce the upfront investment in hardware
and software. This can include using popular frameworks and libraries like
ReactJS or AngularJS for front-end development, and cloud-based databases
like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for back-
end development.
